This error occurs when there's a mismatch between the **version constraints** in your Terraform configuration and the **locked versions** in the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **What the Error Means**
1. **Lock File Inconsistency**:
   - Your `required_providers` block now specifies `~> 3.90.0` for the AzureRM provider.
   - However, the lock file (`.terraform.lock.hcl`) still records `3.0.0` as the locked version.

2. **Why Terraform Cares**:
   - The lock file exists to ensure **consistent provider versions** across your team/CI systems.
   - Terraform detects this version mismatch as a potential risk for inconsistent behavior.

### **How to Fix It**
Run the command Terraform suggests:
```sh
terraform init -upgrade
```

This will:
1. Re-evaluate all provider version constraints
2. Download the newest allowed version (`≥ 3.90.0, < 4.0.0`)
3. Update the lock file to match your configuration

### **Key Notes**
- **What `-upgrade` Does**: 
  - Normally, `terraform init` uses locked versions. The `-upgrade` flag ignores the lock file and finds new versions matching your constraints.

- **Impact**:
  - Upgrading from 3.0.0 → 3.90.0 might introduce minor breaking changes (check [AzureRM changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)).

- **Alternative Solutions**:
  - If you want to keep using 3.0.0, change your constraint back to `= 3.0.0`
  - To regenerate the lock file from scratch:
    ```sh
    rm .terraform.lock.hcl
    terraform init
    ```

### **Best Practice**
- Commit the updated `.terraform.lock.hcl` to version control after running `init -upgrade` to ensure team consistency.

This error indicates that you're trying to create resources in an **Azure subscription that has been disabled and set to read-only mode**. Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

### **Error Breakdown**
- **Error Code**: `ReadOnlyDisabledSubscription`
- **Meaning**: 
  - The Azure subscription (`d23c01fa-5060-43cd-a999-9dd91ef91994`) is either:
    - Past due on payments
    - Manually disabled by an admin
    - Reached spending limits
  - Azure automatically sets disabled subscriptions to **read-only mode** (no resource creation/modification allowed).

### **How to Fix It**
1. **Check Subscription Status**:
   ```sh
   az account show --subscription "d23c01fa-5060-43cd-a999-9dd91ef91994"
   ```
   - Look for `"state": "Disabled"` in the output.

2. **Re-enable the Subscription**:
   - **If payment is due**: Clear the outstanding balance in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade).
   - **If disabled by admin**: Contact your Azure subscription administrator to re-enable it.
   - **For spending limits**: Remove spending caps (Portal → Subscriptions → Your Subscription → Spending limits).

3. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - **Switch to a different subscription** (if you have access to others):
     ```sh
     az account set --subscription "ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
     ```
   - **Update your Terraform configuration** to target an active subscription:
     ```hcl
     provider "azurerm" {
       features {}
       subscription_id = "ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"  # Replace with enabled sub ID
     }
     ```

### **Prevention for Future**
- Set up **Azure Budget Alerts** to avoid accidental disablement.
- For production, use **multiple subscriptions** (dev/test/prod) to isolate impact.

### **Verification**
After re-enabling:
1. Confirm the subscription is active:
   ```sh
   az account list --output table
   ```
2. Retry Terraform:
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

Based on your Azure subscription output, here's the analysis and recommended actions:

### Current Subscription Status
- **State**: `"Warned"` (pre-disabled state)
- **Name**: "Azure subscription 1"
- **Admin User**: cadmin@lawcof.com
- **Default Domain**: lawcof.com

### What "Warned" State Means
1. **Payment Issues** (Most Common)
   - Outstanding balance/payment failure
   - Approaching spending limit

2. **Administrative Action**
   - Subscription owner/global admin may have initiated a warning state

3. **Compliance Issues**
   - Potential policy violations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Financial Status**:
   ```bash
   az consumption budget list --subscription "d23c01fa-5060-43cd-a999-9dd91ef91994"
   ```

2. **View Outstanding Balance**:
   - Portal: https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade
   - Look for "Payment overdue" notifications

3. **Contact Your Admin**:
   ```bash
   az ad user show --id cadmin@lawcof.com --query "mail" -o tsv
   ```
   (Verifies admin contact email)

### Terraform Workaround (Temporary)
While resolving the subscription issue, you can:

1. **Switch to Another Subscription**:
   ```bash
   az account list --output table
   az account set --subscription "HEALTHY_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
   ```

2. **Update Terraform Provider**:
   ```hcl
   provider "azurerm" {
     features {}
     subscription_id = "HEALTHY_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
   }
   ```

### Critical Timeline
- "Warned" typically gives you **30 days** before automatic disablement
- After disablement, resources remain but become read-only

### Recommended Permanent Fixes
1. **Payment Methods**:
   - Update credit card/payment information
   - Set up invoice payments if applicable

2. **Spending Protection**:
   ```bash
   az consumption budget create --amount 1000 \
     --time-grain monthly \
     --budget-name "MonthlyGuardrail" \
     --category cost \
     --subscription-id "d23c01fa-5060-43cd-a999-9dd91ef91994"
   ```

3. **Multi-Subscription Strategy**:
   - Create separate dev/test/prod subscriptions
   - Apply different billing alerts for each
